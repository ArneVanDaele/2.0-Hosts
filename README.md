# 2.0 Hosts

This repository contains a list of web hosts that run a PHP version greater than PHP 5.5.9, which is required for MyBB 2.0.

This list is in no way complete and does not guarantee that a given host is sure to work flawlessly. We urge community members to submit suggestions and pull requests with updates about hosts either currently on the list or that aren't currently listed.

## Where did this data come from?

Some of this data is sourced from the excellent [phpversions.info](https://github.com/philsturgeon/phpversions.info) which was created by @philsturgeon and is maintained by the PHP community at large. The data has simply been formatted to match our requirements.

Any new data that we receive will be sent upstream back to phpversions.info wherever possible to benefit the rest of the community.

## Contributing

To contribute to this list, please open a pull request with an edit against the `hosts.md` file ensuring that the company names are kept in alphabetical order.

Please try to keep the list to shared hosting companies rather than VPS or dedicated server providers where users can usually install any PHP version they wish.
